### Social Media Data Analysis with Pandas

**Introduction to Pandas**

Pandas is a powerful and widely-used Python library designed for data manipulation and analysis. It provides easy-to-use data structures like DataFrames and Series, which allow for efficient handling of tabular data. With Pandas, you can clean, transform, filter, and aggregate data quickly and intuitively.

In data analysis projects, Pandas is used to:

Load data from various file formats like CSV, Excel, and SQL databases.

Explore and summarize datasets by calculating statistics, identifying missing values, and sorting data.

Group and aggregate data to find trends and patterns.

Filter and clean data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and selecting relevant columns.

Prepare data for visualization or machine learning by transforming and reshaping it.

In this project, Pandas was used extensively to analyze social media usage and addiction patterns, helping to uncover insights on platform preferences, addiction scores, and mental health impacts among students.
